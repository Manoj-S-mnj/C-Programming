## 📁 File Structure & Descriptions

### 🧮 **Basic Programs**
- `Check_digit_or_not.c` — Checks whether a character is a digit.
- `Vowel_or_consonent.c` — Determines if a character is a vowel or consonant.
- `nagative number.c` — Identifies and prints negative numbers.
- `Binary_to_decimal.c` — Converts a binary number to decimal.

---

### 🧵 **String Operations**
- `String_anagram.c` — Checks if two strings are anagrams.
- `Deleting_vowels.c` — Removes vowels from a given string.
- `Replacing_the_white_space.c` — Replaces all whitespaces in a string.
- `Removing_white_space.c` — Removes all whitespaces from a string.
- `copy_string.c` — Copies one string to another.
- `remove_a_char.c` — Removes a specific character from a string.
- `replace_first_accurance_of_vowel.c` — Replaces the first occurrence of a vowel in a string.
- `count_given_char.c` — Counts occurrences of a given character.
- `count_of_vowels_and_consonents.c` — Counts vowels and consonants in a string.
- `count_of_numbers_alphabets_specialCharecters.txt` — Counts digits, alphabets, and special characters in a string.

### 🧮 **Array-Based Programs**
- `Reverse_an_array.c` — Reverses the elements in an array.
- `greatest_element_in_array.c` — Finds the largest element in an array.
- `minimum and maximum in array.c` — Finds both the minimum and maximum in an array.
- `missing_element_in_array.c` — Identifies a missing element in an array.
- `sorting a given array.c` — Sorts an array in ascending order.
- `peek element in array.c` — Finds a peak element (greater than its neighbors).
- `sum of Non-repeating values in array.c` — Sums elements that occur only once.
- `count the pairs of given sum.c` — Counts array element pairs with a given sum.
- `Kth smallest and Kth largest.c` — Finds the K-th smallest and largest elements.
- `union&intersection.c` — Computes the union and intersection of two arrays.

### 🧪 **Bitwise & Binary**
- `0's&1's.c` — Counts the number of 0s and 1s in a binary string.
